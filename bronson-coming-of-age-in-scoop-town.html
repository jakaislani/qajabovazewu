I don't know whether to approach him; he seems absorbed by his own thoughts, but after a time he yields. "you can talk to me now. I wouldn't be sitting here if I didn't want to talk. I'd be somewhere else."</p><p>I was wondering about that.</p><p>"I had a very bad experience on the plane in from California yesterday. There was a man on the plane, sitting across from me, and they were showing an old <a href=#>Greer Garson</a> movie. He said, Hey, why aren't you in that? The picture was made before I even became an actor. I said, Why aren't you? I think I made him understand how stupid his question was.</p><p>"When I'm in public, I even try to hide. I keep as quiet as possible so that I'm not noticed. Not that I hide behind doorways or anything ridiculous like that, but I hide by not making waves. I also try to make myself seem as unapproachable as possible."</p><p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/balder-and-dash/bronson-coming-of-age-in-scoop-town/Bronson_1973-thumb-260x376-24128.jpg width=260 height=376 alt=Bronson_1973.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p>More silence. Phil Rhodes, the make-up man, is leafing through a copy of Cosmopolitan. Suddenly he whoops and holds up a centerfold of <a href=#>Jim Brown</a>.</p><p>"Will you look at this," he says.</p><p>"Would you ever do anything like that, Charlie?"</p><p>"Are you kidding?" Bronson said. "What a bunch of crap. Look at that. Old Jim. People are so hung up on sex."</p><p>And, inexplicably, that sets Bronson talking "I've been trying to make it with girls for as long as I can remember," he says. "I remember my first time. I was five and a half years old, and she was six. This was in 1928 or 1929. It happened at about the worst time in my life. We had been thrown out of our house . . ."</p><p>The house was in Ehrenfeld, known as Scooptown, and it was a company house owned by the Pennsylvania Coal and Coke Company. When the miners went out on strike, they were evicted from their homes, and the Buchinsky family went to live in the basement of a house occupied by another miner and his eight children. "This would have been the summer before I started school," Bronson says. "I remember my father had shaved us all bald to avoid lice. Times were poor. I wore hand-me-downs. And because the kids just older than me in the family were girls, sometimes I had to wear my sisters' hand-me-downs. I remember going to school in a dress. And my socks, when I got home sometimes I'd have to take them off and give them to my brother to wear into the mines.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmn52RqcKzsdJomaunnqi8r3nCqKSippdivKd5wKCcZqGeYsCku86pZK2np6M%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbronson-coming-of-age-in-scoop-town.html&text=Bronson%3a%20Coming%20of%20age%20in%20Scoop%20Town%20%7c%20Features&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbronson-coming-of-age-in-scoop-town.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbronson-coming-of-age-in-scoop-town.html&title=Bronson%3a%20Coming%20of%20age%20in%20Scoop%20Town%20%7c%20Features" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbronson-coming-of-age-in-scoop-town.html&title=Bronson%3a%20Coming%20of%20age%20in%20Scoop%20Town%20%7c%20Features" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbronson-coming-of-age-in-scoop-town.html&title=Bronson%3a%20Coming%20of%20age%20in%20Scoop%20Town%20%7c%20Features" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbronson-coming-of-age-in-scoop-town.html&description=Bronson%3a%20Coming%20of%20age%20in%20Scoop%20Town%20%7c%20Features" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./easy-vegetarian-pho.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Easy Vegetarian Pho">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nancy-daly-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nancy Daly Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
