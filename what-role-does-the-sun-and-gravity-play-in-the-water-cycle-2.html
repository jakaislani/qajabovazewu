This keeps the planet moving in an orbit around the sun. Because of the sun’s gravitational pull, all the planets in our solar system orbit around it.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-3-parts-of-the-water-cycle-are-a-result-of-gravity></span>What 3 parts of the water cycle are a result of gravity?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>The Hydrological Cycle</b><ul class=i8Z77e><li class=TrT0Xe>Precipitation.

This all depends on the Sun’s energy. Without the Sun there would be no water cycle, which means no clouds, <b>no rain—no weather</b>!” “And without the Sun’s heat, the world’s oceans would be frozen!” added Marisol.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-does-gravity-cause-rain></span>How does gravity cause rain?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>clouds are made of water droplets, ice, dust, and other particles in the air. … when the water droplets in the clouds get too heavy they will fall (rain) – gravity is <b>the force pulling the droplets toward the Earth’s surface</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-role-does-the-force-of-gravity-play-in-the-cycling-of-earths-materials></span>What role does the force of gravity play in the cycling of Earth’s materials?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The force of gravity. This allows <b>the earth to maintain the atmosphere encompassing its surface and provides the driving force for the downward movement of materials</b> in processes involving the cycling of matter.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-effect-of-the-heat-of-the-sun-to-the-water></span>What is the effect of the heat of the sun to the water?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In the water cycle, <b>evaporation</b> occurs when sunlight warms the surface of the water. The heat from the sun makes the water molecules move faster and faster, until they move so fast they escape as a gas. Once evaporated, a molecule of water vapor spends about ten days in the air.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-processes-are-part-of-the-water-cycle-what-role-does-gravity-play-in-the-water-cycle-site-2></span>What processes are part of the water cycle What role does gravity play in the water cycle Site 2?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>While sunlight is the energy source, the greatest force propelling the water cycle is gravity. Gravity is the force of attraction between two objects, and Earth’s gravity pulls matter downward, toward its center. It <b>pulls precipitation down from clouds and pulls water downhill</b>. Gravity also moves air and ocean water.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-does-the-sun-and-the-ocean-interact-in-the-water-cycle></span>How does the sun and the ocean interact in the water cycle?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>When water at the ocean’s surface is <b>heated by the Sun it gains energy</b>. With enough energy, the molecules of liquid water change into water vapor and move into the air. This process is called evaporation. … Energy from the Sun causes water in the oceans to evaporate.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-water-gravity></span>What is water gravity?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Water has a <b>specific gravity equal to 1</b>. Materials with a specific gravity less than 1 are less dense than water, and will float on the pure liquid; substances with a specific gravity more than 1 are more dense than water, and will sink.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-your-role-in-the-water-cycle></span>What is your role in the water cycle?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Bodies of water, clouds, evaporation and condensation</b> all play vital roles in the water cycle, but so do living things. … Close to 10 percent of all water enters the water cycle due to plant transpiration. Animals contribute to the water cycle via respiration, perspiration and urination.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=which-of-the-five-water-cycle-processes-are-directly-caused-by-the-force-of-gravity></span>Which of the five water cycle processes are directly caused by the force of gravity?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Which parts of the water cycle are caused by the force of gravity? <b>precipitation, runoff, infiltration, grand water flow</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-role-do-oceans-play-in-the-water-cycle></span>What role do oceans play in the water cycle?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Not only do the <b>oceans provide evaporated water to the water cycle</b>, they also allow water to move all around the globe as ocean currents. Oceans are the storehouses of water nature uses to run the water cycle.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-4-stages-of-the-water-cycle></span>What are the 4 stages of the water cycle?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>There are four main parts to the water cycle: <b>Evaporation, Convection, Precipitation and Collection</b>. Evaporation is when the sun heats up water in rivers or lakes or the ocean and turns it into vapour or steam. The water vapour or steam leaves the river, lake or ocean and goes into the air.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-role-do-aquifers-play-in-the-water-cycle-quizlet></span>What role do aquifers play in the water cycle quizlet?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>What role do aquifers play in the water cycle? … They <b>are the main source of water on Earth</b>. d. They move water through capillarity.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-role-of-the-sun-and-ocean-in-the-weather-climate-and-the-water-cycle></span>What is the role of the sun and ocean in the weather climate and the water cycle?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The water cycle is <b>important to weather and climate and, ultimately, to all life on Earth</b>. … This solar energy drives the cycle by evaporating water from the oceans, lakes, rivers, and even the soil. Other water moves from plants to the atmosphere through the process of transpiration.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-does-the-sun-drive-the-movement-of-water-from-the-oceans-to-the-continents></span>How does the sun drive the movement of water from the oceans to the continents?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The sun, which drives the water cycle, <b>heats water in the oceans</b>. Some of it evaporates as vapor into the air. Ice and snow can sublimate directly into water vapor. … Some precipitation falls as snow and can accumulate as ice caps and glaciers, which can store frozen water for thousands of years.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-does-gravity-hold-water-on-earth></span>How does gravity hold water on Earth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>This attraction causes the water on this “near side” of Earth to be <b>pulled toward the moon</b>. As gravitational force acts to draw the water closer to the moon, inertia attempts to keep the water in place. … In this way the combination of gravity and inertia create two bulges of water.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-role-does-the-ocean-play-in-global-warming></span>What role does the ocean play in global warming?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Ocean currents act much like a conveyor belt, <b>transporting warm water and precipitation from the equator toward the poles and cold water from the poles back to the tropics</b>. Thus, ocean currents regulate global climate, helping to counteract the uneven distribution of solar radiation reaching Earth’s surface.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-does-the-ocean-affect-the-weather></span>How does the ocean affect the weather?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The ocean influences weather patterns by <b>distributing heat and moisture around the globe</b>. … Warm water is also evaporated from the ocean into the atmosphere, where it can condense and form clouds, which can eventually lead to rain.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-does-the-suns-heat-affect-the-humidity-of-a-place></span>How does the sun’s heat affect the humidity of a place?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>If the water vapor content stays the same and the temperature drops</b>, the relative humidityincreases. If the water vapor content stays the same and the temperature rises, the relative humidity decreases. This is because colder air doesn’t require as much moisture to become saturated as warmer air.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-suns-role-in-causing-atmospheric-movement></span>What is the Sun’s role in causing atmospheric movement?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Solar power drives Earth’s climate. Energy from <b>the sun heats Earth’s surface</b>, warms the atmosphere, provides energy for photosynthesis, causes evaporation, drives the weather and water cycles, and powers the ocean currents.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-role-do-the-oceans-play-in-moderating-climate-change-quizlet></span>What role do the oceans play in moderating climate change quizlet?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Oceans absorb CO2 from the atmosphere</b> which helps moderate the Earth’s climate. They also absorb the heat in the atmosphere, but by doing this, the ocean’s temperature has risen, which kills organisms.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-would-earth-be-like-if-ocean-water-did-not-move></span>What would Earth be like if ocean water did not move?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>If ocean water did not move, Earth would <b>be hot in the equatorial region and frigid in the polar regions</b>. The temperature would track much more with latitude than it does.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-role-of-the-sun-in-forming-convection-currents-in-earths-water-and-air></span>What is the role of the Sun in forming convection currents in Earth’s water and air?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Convection drives the circulation of air in the earth’s atmosphere. The <b>sun heats the air near the earth’s equator</b>, which becomes less dense and rises upward. As it rises, it cools and becomes less dense than the air around it, spreading out and descending toward the equator again.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46wn5qsXae8rbGMnaaeq12ptaZ50q6lZpmemXqovsCvoK2xXaW5osWMoqVmrJiaerit056pZpupmLmmeZFo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-role-does-the-sun-and-gravity-play-in-the-water-cycle-2.html&text=What%20role%20does%20the%20sun%20and%20gravity%20play%20in%20the%20water%20cycle&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-role-does-the-sun-and-gravity-play-in-the-water-cycle-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-role-does-the-sun-and-gravity-play-in-the-water-cycle-2.html&title=What%20role%20does%20the%20sun%20and%20gravity%20play%20in%20the%20water%20cycle" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-role-does-the-sun-and-gravity-play-in-the-water-cycle-2.html&title=What%20role%20does%20the%20sun%20and%20gravity%20play%20in%20the%20water%20cycle" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-role-does-the-sun-and-gravity-play-in-the-water-cycle-2.html&title=What%20role%20does%20the%20sun%20and%20gravity%20play%20in%20the%20water%20cycle" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-role-does-the-sun-and-gravity-play-in-the-water-cycle-2.html&description=What%20role%20does%20the%20sun%20and%20gravity%20play%20in%20the%20water%20cycle" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-akira-toriyamas-dragon-ball-z-remains-the-quintessential-anime.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Akira Toriyamas Dragon Ball Z remains the quintessential anime">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sauteed-green-beans.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sauted Green Beans">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
