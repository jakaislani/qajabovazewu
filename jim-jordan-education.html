He served as its inaugural chair from 2015 to 2017 and has held the position of vice chair since 2017.</p><p>His influence extended to the House Oversight Committee, where he held the ranking member position from 2019 to 2020. Subsequently, he transitioned to become the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, eventually becoming its chair in 2023.</p><p>Notably, Jordan has maintained a close alliance with former President Donald Trump. During Trump’s presidency, Jordan actively worked to discredit investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election. He even staged a sit-in to obstruct a Trump impeachment inquiry hearing related to the Trump–Zelenskyy telephone controversy.</p><p>After Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election and Trump’s attempts to overturn the results, Jordan supported legal challenges to contest the election outcome and voted against certifying the Electoral College results. Furthermore, he declined cooperation with the U.S. House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack, which issued a subpoena to him on May 12, 2022.</p><p>In July 2008, <a href=# rel=noopener>Jim Jordan</a> became the first member of Congress to endorse the “No Climate Tax” pledge crafted by the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity.</p><p>During his time in Congress, Jordan consistently voted in favor of policies such as opening the Outer Continental Shelf to oil drilling, preventing the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases, and opposing greenhouse gas limitations in Clean Air Act regulations. He also voted against measures supporting tax credits for renewable electricity, incentives for renewable energy and energy conservation, and reductions in subsidies for oil and gas exploration.</p><p>On the subject of abortion, Jordan is firmly against it and advocates for the cessation of federal funding to Planned Parenthood. In a controversial incident in July 2022, Jordan initially disputed a report of a 10-year-old Ohio girl traveling to Indiana for a legal abortion after being raped. He later deleted his tweet after the rapist was arrested and confessed to the crime, confirming the accuracy of the abortion report.</p><p>Jordan is an outspoken critic of “Big Tech” companies and opposes proposals to break them up through antitrust enforcement, contending that the Democratic Party is influenced by these companies and supports online censorship of conservatives.</p><p>Regarding taxes, during his tenure in the Ohio Senate, Jordan supported the Tax and Expenditure Limitation Amendment, which aimed to mandate a public vote for any tax increase or spending exceeding certain limits.</p><p>In the realm of foreign policy, Jordan has taken stances that occasionally diverge from his party’s position. For instance, he opposed condemning Trump’s decision to withdraw forces from Syria, and he, along with a select group of Republicans, voted to end Saudi assistance in the war in Yemen. Additionally, he voted in favor of repealing the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) against Iraq.</p><p>On the matter of LGBT rights, Jordan cosponsored a resolution in 2015 to amend the U.S. Constitution to ban same-sex marriage and condemned the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which affirmed the unconstitutionality of same-sex marriage bans.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jim Jordan Education</h2><p>Jim Jordan’s education includes both his undergraduate and graduate studies. Jim Jordan earned his bachelor’s degree in economics from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. During his time at the university, he achieved considerable success in wrestling, becoming a two-time NCAA Division I wrestling champion in the 134-pound (61 kg) weight class. He won these titles in the 1985 and 1986 NCAA championship matches.</p><p>After completing his undergraduate studies, Jim Jordan continued his education by pursuing a master’s degree in education. He obtained this degree from Ohio State University.</p><p>Subsequently, Jim Jordan pursued a legal education by attending the Capital University Law School. There, he earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqOgpmWapL%2Blrc1mnJ2tk5bBqrvNaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjim-jordan-education.html&text=Jim%20Jordan%20Education&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjim-jordan-education.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjim-jordan-education.html&title=Jim%20Jordan%20Education" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjim-jordan-education.html&title=Jim%20Jordan%20Education" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjim-jordan-education.html&title=Jim%20Jordan%20Education" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjim-jordan-education.html&description=Jim%20Jordan%20Education" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bronny-james.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet Bronny James-Eldest Son of NBA Player LeBron James Bio, Girlfriend &amp;amp; Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./heather-small-net-worth-150151.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Heather Small Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
