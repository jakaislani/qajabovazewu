Silicone caulk dries rapidly and is a popular option for forming a barrier between plastic surfaces because of its ease of application.

Spar urethane is believed to be far less difficult to apply than polyurethane, according to some experts. It is applied in the same method as polyurethane; however, it dries more quickly and does not take as many layers or applications to obtain a glossy finish as polyurethane. Spar urethane cures by oxidation rather than drying, so make sure there is plenty of air circulation.
