Prior to coaching at Detroit, Barry held assistant coaching positions within the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and San Francisco 49ers franchises, Northern Arizona University, and UNLV.</p><p>Prior to this, he worked as the defensive coordinator for the Washington Commanders from 2015 to 2016 and the Detroit Lions from 2007 to 2008, as well as the assistant head coach and linebackers coach for the Los Angeles Rams from 2017 to 2020.</p><p>Barry has also worked as an assistant coach for the San Francisco 49ers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and San Diego Chargers in the past.</p><p>Joe Barry’s net worth is $5 Million. He has made such an amount of wealth from his primary career as&nbsp;a football coach.</p><p>At a press conference on December 21, 2008, following the Lions’ 42–7 loss to the New Orleans Saints, Detroit News sports columnist&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Rob Parker</a>&nbsp;addressed a question about Barry to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Rod Marinelli</a>, inquiring whether Marinelli wished that his daughter had “married a better defensive coordinator.” (Barry was the Lions’ defensive coordinator at the time.) The question was criticized as unprofessional and inappropriate.</p><p>The next day, Parker wrote that the comment was “an attempt at humor” and not a malicious attack. Parker has not written for the Detroit News since and has not attended any press conferences since the incident, including the one Marinelli gave following his dismissal as head coach of the Lions. On January 6, 2009, the Detroit News announced that Parker had resigned from the newspaper the previous week.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/25084040/Joe-Barry4.jpg><p>Barry signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars as linebackers coach. On January 26, 2010, it was announced that the Jaguars released Barry from his contract so he can join the University of Southern California as their linebackers coach. Barry was hired as the Washington Redskins defensive coordinator for the 2015 season, and was fired after the 2016 season.</p><p>On January 14, 2017, Barry was hired by the Los Angeles Rams as the team’s linebackers coach and Assistant Head Coach.</p><p>Barry began working for Northern Arizona University in 1996 as their linebackers coach.</p><p>He held that position from 1996 to 1998 before accepting a similar position at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) in 1999.</p><p>The names of his siblings if he has any are unknown.</p><p>Barry is the son of former Football Coach, Mike Barry and the son-in-law of Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Rod Marinelli</a>.</p><p>Chris Marinelli Barry&nbsp;has been with him for quite a long time now after barring four children for the American football coach.</p><p>She obviously became famous when she married Joe Barry.</p><p>Not much is known about her as no information about her, apart from the fact that she is Joe Barry wife, is available online.</p><p>It is not too clear who her parents are, and it is not known if she has any siblings.</p><p>Apparently, the couple has kept everything about their relationship private; not everyone likes to put their relationship in the public domain.</p><p>Given that Joe Barry is very popular because of his career choice, they have kept things private when it comes to their relationship.</p><p>We could not find any information about how they met and it is not also clear when they got married.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Ghgossip.com</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqOmnmWSlr%2BzxYycn6KklKeyr3s%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjoe-barry-children.html&text=Joe%20Barry%20Children%3a%20Does%20Joe%20Barry%20have%20children%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoe-barry-children.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoe-barry-children.html&title=Joe%20Barry%20Children%3a%20Does%20Joe%20Barry%20have%20children%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjoe-barry-children.html&title=Joe%20Barry%20Children%3a%20Does%20Joe%20Barry%20have%20children%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjoe-barry-children.html&title=Joe%20Barry%20Children%3a%20Does%20Joe%20Barry%20have%20children%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoe-barry-children.html&description=Joe%20Barry%20Children%3a%20Does%20Joe%20Barry%20have%20children%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mario-dies-on-31st-march-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="March 31st Is The Day Mario Dies, According To Upset Nintendo Fans">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-many-people-in-europe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How many people in europe">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
