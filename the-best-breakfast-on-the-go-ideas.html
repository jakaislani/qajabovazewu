But who has the time for that?! No really, who? I want to know who they are so I can copy their life and have time every morning to sit down and eat a filling and nutritious breakfast slowly while staring out a window at a beautiful view of nature.</p><p>But until I find that person to be my life coach/role model, I will be eating breakfast on the go. Whether that’s in my car, the office, or over my apartment trashcan one minute after I was supposed to leave that morning, I want to optimize for protein, enjoyability, and portability. To that end, here are our top seven breakfast on the go ideas. Let us know if any of these grab-and-go breakfast ideas speak to your specific brand of morning chaos.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

Is there anything better than a warm waffle ever? Toaster waffles are the epitome of a set-it-and-forget-it, grab-it-and-go quick breakfast, with the added bonus of being warm. You pop two of these bad boys in the toaster on low, keep getting ready, then grab them on your way out. You can even add peanut butter between the waffles for more protein. But, y’all. Taste-wise, these waffles don’t need a thing. Sporked senior writer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Myrick</a> said these were “a little buttery, it has some sweetness and a lot of fluff.” Editor-in-chief <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Justine Sterling</a> said they had the perfect hint of vanilla and were “crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.” Ugh, YUM.</p><p>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Get Toasty with the Best Frozen Waffles</a></p><p>YUH! GET SWOLE! GO YOU! If you’re looking to get those macros in at 6:30 a.m., first of all, good for you. I admire your ability to motivate yourself to do…well…anything. Second of all, we found a protein bar that doesn’t have that signature protein-y aftertaste. Can you believe it? I can’t and I’m writing this thing. Jordan noted that this bar tastes like “a Rice Krispies treat meets a Reese’s Cup.” Sporked contributor Danny Palumbo said the texture was excellent too, with a “toothsome meatiness and soft crunchiness” that were a “gosh darn delight.” PLUS 20 WHOLE GRAMS OF PROTEIN. Whaaaaat?!?</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Get Absolutely Yoked with the 7 Best Tasting Protein Bars</a></strong></p><p>Not gonna lie, I love this yogurt. I had it every day in my lunch in high school. Would I eat it for a quick breakfast? Oh, 1,000%, yes. Sporked managing editor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gwynedd Stuart</a> said the “tartness of the lemon and the natural tartness of the rich, decadent yogurt are a match made in heaven,” and I couldn’t agree more. If you are an office breakfast kind of gal, this is the breakfast for you. You could even bring a Nature Valley granola bar, crush it, and sprinkle the bits on top to add more deliciousness (believe me, at that point, it truly tastes like a pie).</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Grab a Spoon for the 6 Best Greek Yogurt Flavors</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Special K</strong></a><p>What’s so special about it? Well, for starters, it was our favorite healthy cereal. Cereal and milk can be a difficult on-the-go breakfast (<a href=#>though not as hard as it used to be</a>), but that’s not what I’m suggesting here. I’m sayin’ take a baggie or a container, fill it with dry cereal, and scoop flakes into your mouth with your hand. I’ve done this at work, while driving, while taking an exam—the wonders of a cereal baggie truly never cease. You’re welcome! Plus, as Gwynedd said, this cereal has “an addictive crunch, a pleasant sweetness, and that satisfying feeling that you’re doing something good for yourself.” You can’t really go wrong with this one.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>Best Healthy Cereal: 6 Best Healthy Cereals for a Good-for-You Morning</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Sun-Maid Cinnamon Swirl Raisin Bread</strong></a><p>I haven’t had cinnamon-raisin toast in years, but now I want some right this instant. Just like the aforementioned toaster waffles, this bread can heat up in the toaster while you finish deciding which outfit will say to your boss “I woke up early and meditated then journaled about my career goals before working out, cooking myself an egg white omelet, and biking to work without breaking a sweat,” when really you rolled out of bed ten minutes late, got dressed, and then ate a delicious buttered piece of cinnamon-raisin toast while bounding to your car like a rubber band ball made of pure chaos. But the one thing you don’t have to worry about? This bread. Sun-Main doesn’t skimp on the raisins, which Danny Palumbo called “deliciously sweet and fruity.” He also pointed out that “the cinnamon swirl is fragrant and spiced and accentuates the lovely raisins, too.” I feel like this one would also be good at midnight?</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Cinnamon Raisin Bread: The 5 Best for Your Sweet Breakfast Cravings</a></strong></p><p>I mean, a warm, buttered English muffin in the morning? Yes, please. It’s portable, it’s customizable (butter, jam, peanut butter, cream cheese and lox, a single prune), and you can add as much or as little healthy stuff to it as you’d like. And these specific English muffins? Ooooh weee. They aren’t as dry as other English muffins can be, plus they “won’t kick you in the teeth with yeast, but the sourness of the sourdough definitely gives these an edge over a lot of regular English muffins in the flavor department,” according to Gwynedd. All in all, a win-win of a muffin.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Make a Bomb Benedict with the 7 Best English Muffins</a></strong></p><strong>GoMacro Sunny Uplift (Cherries + Berries)</strong><p>Are you Vegan? Well, we gotcha covered, buddy friendo. This vegan protein bar is so McFrickin good, you won’t miss any of the ingredients that would make it non-vegan. Gwynedd described it as being “way more like a chewy granola bar than most of the others, which makes it seem more like actual food. While so many of these just taste kind of dusty (like protein, I guess), this one is bursting with berry flavor. It’s full of chewy dried cherries that give it a nice tart flavor.” We get it. Being vegan doesn’t mean you have to have your life together enough to make JUST Egg omelets and sit down for some vegan slow food every morning. No one does. We’re all just a bunch of vegans and non-vegans trying to make it until lunch.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Vegan Protein Bars: Our 8 Favorites</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKyYmnqjsdKtZJuqlZa4p63SrWSopl2ptaZ5xqhkopyVlsBw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-best-breakfast-on-the-go-ideas.html&text=The%20Best%20Breakfast%20on%20the%20Go%20Ideas&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-best-breakfast-on-the-go-ideas.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-best-breakfast-on-the-go-ideas.html&title=The%20Best%20Breakfast%20on%20the%20Go%20Ideas" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-best-breakfast-on-the-go-ideas.html&title=The%20Best%20Breakfast%20on%20the%20Go%20Ideas" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-best-breakfast-on-the-go-ideas.html&title=The%20Best%20Breakfast%20on%20the%20Go%20Ideas" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-best-breakfast-on-the-go-ideas.html&description=The%20Best%20Breakfast%20on%20the%20Go%20Ideas" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./can-purple-be-a-boy-color.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Can purple be a Boy color?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./josh-richards-net-worth-157974.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Josh Richards Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
