He struggled to recover after being fired from CBS News, but he has now found a new position and is working to rehabilitate his reputation.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Josh_Elliot_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Josh Elliot? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Josh, although being controversial for leaving so many positions in such short periods of time, has demonstrated his abilities, and his annual compensation is now $2 million. His fortune has grown over the years, and it is now estimated to be around $5 million.</p><h2><span id=Josh_Elliot-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Josh Elliot- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>Joshua Michael Elliott was born on July 6, 1971, in Los Angeles, California, USA, to a mother named Susan who gave him up for adoption – his adoptive parents were Charles Elliott and Toni Jordan, but they divorced when he was 13 years old, after Charles came out as gay, and he passed away just two years later. Josh attended Loyola High School in Los Angeles and then matriculated at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p><p>He aspired to play for the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos men’s water polo team but instead ended up writing for the university newspaper, The Daily Nexus. Joshua earned a Bachelor of Arts in English literature in 1993 and a Master of Science in journalism from Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism later that year.</p><h2><span id=Josh_Elliot-_Relationship_Married_Life>Josh Elliot- Relationship, Married Life</span></h2><p>Josh Elliott is married to Liz Cho, a well-known news anchor. The pair married in a wedding ceremony in Montecito, California, in 2015. They don’t have any children.</p><h2><span id=Josh_Elliot-_Professional_Career>Josh Elliot- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Josh began working as a stringer for the Santa Barbara News-Press after graduating from UCSB. Despite returning to school, Josh continued to work and eventually became a television producer for Galaxy Productions. His next media company was 20th Century Fox, where he worked in comedic development before transitioning to physical production. Josh worked for Sports Illustrated for six years after receiving his master’s degree, covering all big sporting events.</p><h3><span id=ESPN_ABC_and_NBC>ESPN, ABC, and NBC</span></h3><p>Josh began to receive offers as his career progressed, and he joined ESPN in 2004.<br>His first assignment was to be a panelist on the programs “Around the Horn” and “Jim Rome is Burning.” His on-air time increased over time, and he began co-hosting “Cold Pizza” and “ESPNEWS,” as well as having his own reports that aired during “SportsCenter.” He then joined Hannah Storm as co-host of “SportsCenter” for a three-hour block beginning at 9:00 a.m.</p><p>After leaving ESPN, Josh joined the anchors of “Good Morning America,” replacing Juju Chang, and worked on “ABC World News” and “Good Afternoon America” for three years. Josh was recruited by NBC, where he stayed from March 2014 until December 2015, although only appeared on “NBC Sports” and its “2014 Kentucky Derby.”</p><h3><span id=CBS_News>CBS News</span></h3><p>Elliott joined CBS News in March 2016, however his contract was terminated in February 2017.<br>Nonetheless, he had grown in popularity as the principal anchor of the digital news service CBSN, which was one of his primary responsibilities. Josh was fairly isolated from the media buzz following his firing from CBS News, and no one knew what his future plans were. He remained silent until mid-2018 when he joined National Geographic and co-hosted “Yellowstone Live” with wildfire expert Chris Packham.</p><p>He is now the host of “First Responders Live,” which airs on Fox television. The show, which started on June 12th, is a documentary about people who respond to all types of emergency calls and are the first on the scene. The series has gotten mixed reviews, and there has been no announcement of a second season as of yet.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><p>Josh is recognized for his towering stature, standing at 6ft 2ins (1.91m).
