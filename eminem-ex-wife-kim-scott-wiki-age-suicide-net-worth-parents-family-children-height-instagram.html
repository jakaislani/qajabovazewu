According to TMZ, police and emergency workers responded to a call of a suicidal person at her home in Michigan on July 30, 2021. When they arrived, Kim was so combative that she had to be restrained by deputies. She was also so violent that paramedics were unable to check her vitals.</p><p>Scott allegedly cut herself as she had several small lacerations on the back of her leg and a fair amount of blood had spilled onto the floor.</p><p>She was rushed to a hospital for both medical and psychological evaluation, but is now back at home and is recovering. It’s unclear if she’s getting additional care.</p><p>Kim reportedly tried to take her own life after her mother, Kathleen Sluck, died at the age of 65 on July 23, 2021, surrounded by her family, according to her obituary. A funeral for Sluck took place at Lee-Ellena Funeral Home on July 29.</p><p>An online obituary shows a heartbreaking comment posted by a user claiming to be Kim was shared on the official memory page days later. It reads via The Sun: “I don’t even know where to begin mom!!! First off I’d like to say I F* LIED TO YOU WHEN I SAID I WOULD BE OK….I LIED WHEN I SAID I CAN DO THIS I PROMISE!!!! F f*** all!!!</p><p>“I don’t even know how to do this without you I just wanted you to not hurt or suffer or fight for me anymore!!!

I hope you know every choice I made was to make you a little happier and your life a little easier!!!</p><p>“I really just want you back mom!!!
