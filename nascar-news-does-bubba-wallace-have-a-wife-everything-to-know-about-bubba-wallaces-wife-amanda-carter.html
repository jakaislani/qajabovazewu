After having an impressive 2023 season, the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>23XI Racing</a> driver has qualified for the playoffs for the first time in his career. While he’s on the right path on the tracks, his off-track life has been going equally well courtesy of his wife, Amanda Carter.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><b>Who Is Bubba Wallace’s Wife Amanda Carter?</b></h2><p>Born on March 30, 1994, in North Carolina, Amanda Carter is one of five children to parents David Ryan Carter and Rebecca Carter. She has three brothers Jason, Brad, and Ryan. Carter also has a sister named Kristen. As reported by Biographyon.com, Carter did her schooling at a local school.</p><p>Later on, she enrolled at Appalachian State University as she went to receive a degree in Finance and Banking. In 2016, she was a senior financial analyst at the Bank of America. Earlier, she was an employee at the Alpha Phi International Fraternity as a Vice President. While she has done well in her career, Carter has been extremely supportive of Bubba Wallace.</p><p>In fact, the couple share quite an interesting story of how they met.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><b>How did Bubba Wallace and Amanda Carter meet?</b></h2><p>Amazingly, Bubba Wallace and Amanda Carter have known each other since their high school days. Having said that, it probably wasn’t love at first sight for the couple. Speaking to The People, Wallace spoke about the time when he was a sophomore in high school and Carter was a freshman.</p><p>He said, “She thought I was nice, but not attractive. I just remember seeing her and I was like, “Wow, she’s beautiful.” While Wallace was fond of Carter from the onset, it wasn’t quite the same with her. Speaking about the same time, she says, “We were in Spanish class in high school, and we sat near each other.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1422921406.jpg><p>She continued, “I don’t remember first meeting, but he would always try to cheat. We were friends. There was three or four of us that did all of our projects together and he always would try to cheat off my exams because I was much smarter than he was!”</p><p>Reacting to this, Wallace said, “I was definitely not good at Spanish and I was trying to do the easy route and she would not budge. She would not.” Quite interestingly, despite being close, the duo couldn’t work out a relationship at that moment.</p><p>Speaking about it, Carter said, “It never worked out. It never hit or landed in high school. I even went to his prom with somebody else from his school.”&nbsp;In fact, it is a lovely story of how things finally worked out for the couple.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><b>When and how did Bubba Wallace and Amanda Carter start dating?</b></h2><p>After finishing their graduation, Bubba Wallace and Amanda Carter stayed in touch. While they spoke only once or twice a year, things took a turn when they reconnected at a football game in 2015. It was after that meeting that they spent more time together.</p><p>In fact, Wallace invited Carter to Las Vegas for one of his races while she was a senior in her college. Recalling that time, she spoke to The People. She said, “It was my senior year spring break. And I didn’t have plans at the time. He was like, ‘Well, I’ll be out in Vegas while you’re on spring break, do you want to come?’ And I said, ‘No,'”</p><p>She then deep-dived into the start of their dating phase. Carter said, “And then he asked a few times again, and I eventually said yes. I was like, well, I have to get to know him more if we’re going to be on vacation for a week together. And we started dating when we got out to Vegas, because we had been talking so much. We had really started to really like each other.”</p><p>After five years of dating, Wallace and Carter finally got engaged in July 2021. In fact, their marriage was quite a celebration.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><b>How did Bubba Wallace and Amanda Carter get married?</b></h2><p>After getting engaged in 2021, Bubba Wallace and Amanda Carter gave it a year before deciding to tie the knot in December 2022. The ceremony was held close to their home in Charlotte, North Carolina. To celebrate their special day, almost 250 guests gathered at JW Marriott in Charlotte on 31st December 2022.</p><p>The couple wanted their wedding to be intimate and romantic, so they opted for all-white flowers with greenery accents and candles. Speaking to The People, Carter said, “We wanted the ceremony, (which was held on the hotel’s 4th floor) to be formal, and then as soon as you walk down the staircase to the reception, we wanted the whole mood to flip,”</p><p>She continued, “The flowers are changing from white to vibrant with pinks, purples, reds, with a lot of sparkle and shine in the room. We wanted the reception to feel like a New Year’s Eve party.”&nbsp;Once the couple exchanged their handwritten vows, they ensured to join their guests for cocktail hour with an open bar.</p><p>In fact, they even went with an unorthodox approach for the main course. On this, Carter said, “We’re not doing a seated dinner with over 200 people. We wanted to make sure that we have time to see everybody. And a seated dinner really can take away from being able to talk to everybody.”</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-nascar-news-bubba-wallace-confesses-mistake-right-after-tying-the-knot-with-his-wife-amanda-carter?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/BUBBA-WALLACE-AND-AMANDA-CARTER-e1684750769740-415x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">Bubba Wallace Confesses Mistake Right After Tying the Knot With His Wife Amanda</p></a><p>There is no doubt that Carter was and is head over heels in love with Wallace. Speaking about their relationship, she said, “We just have such a good bond. I love the time we spend together. We could sit around together all day every day and we don’t get tired of one another.”&nbsp;</p><p>Truly, it is their chemistry that helps them overcome their hectic schedule, support, and find enough time for each other.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><b>How do Bubba Wallace and Amanda Wallace support each other?</b></h2><p>As it is commonly known, marriage itself isn’t a good enough reason to keep two people together. It is the efforts and understanding that matter more, which has been the case with Bubba Wallace and Amanda Carter. Given Wallace’s intense NASCAR Cup Series schedule, Carter’s support matters a lot in his professional journey. In fact, she’s quite frequently seen in races supporting the #23 driver.</p><p>It is no secret that Bubba Wallace has had his struggles in the Cup Series. During those testing times, Carter has been his strongest pillar of support. In an interview with the Associated Press last year, Wallace funnily expressed how she deserved the credit for where he is in his NASCAR career.</p><p>He said, “She should get a lot of it [credit], but we’re competitive so I won’t give her 100% because, maybe she’s at 99% but she’s still got to work for that last little bit.” Sometimes she really [makes me mad] because I will be ranting about something, ‘Can you believe this happened?’ and her response will be, ‘Well, let’s look at why it happened this way.'”</p><p>In fact, Wallace highlighted how the difference in approach helps the couple balance their life together. He said, “She’s always seeing things in a different light and it makes you appreciate that you can see things differently from someone else’s perspective, you know? We’re definitely polar opposites but it balances out really well. Life’s good with her.”</p><p><strong>WATCH THIS STORY: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>NASCAR Insider Exposes Bubba Wallace’s Playoff Secret</a></strong></p><p>Indeed, it is a blessing for Wallace to have someone like Amanda Carter in his life.
