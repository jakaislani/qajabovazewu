He shares the same parents with his sister, Sheila Woodward.</p><p>He is predominantly of English ancestry; his Welsh maternal grandfather, Welsh maternal grandmother, Somerset and Wiltshire-born English paternal grandfather, and Wiltshire-born English paternal grandmother were all born in Wales.</p><p>He went to Pontypridd Central Secondary Modern School, Wood Road Junior School, and Wood Road Infants School. At a young age, he started singing; he frequently sang in his school choir, at family events, and at weddings.</p><p>He disliked athletics and school, but his singing ability helped him become more self-assured. He received a TB diagnosis when he was 12 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tom Jones career</h2><p>Jones’s career began with a string of top 10 hits in the 1960s and he has since toured regularly, with appearances in Las Vegas from 1967 to 2011. His voice has been described by AllMusic as a “full-throated, robust baritone”.</p><p>Gospel, pop, R&B, show tunes, country, dance, and dance were among the genres Jones has performed. He was described as a “musical chameleon who could slide from deep rasp to pop coo, with a voice as velvety as it was lovely,” by the New York Times in 2008.</p><p>His hit songs include “It’s Not Unusual,” “What’s New Pussycat?” (the theme song for the James Bond movie Thunderball from 1965), “Green, Green Grass of Home,” “Delilah,” “She’s a Lady,” “Sex Bomb,” and a cover of Prince’s “Kiss.” He has sold over 100 million records worldwide.</p><p>Additionally, Jones has dabbled in acting on occasion, making his screen debut in the lead role of the television movie Pleasure Cove (1979). Additionally, he made a cameo appearance in Tim Burton’s movie Mars Attacks! (1996).</p><p>He was nominated for a 1970 Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy for his work as the host of the show This Is Tom Jones.</p><p>He performed in his first dramatic acting role in a Playhouse Presents episode in 2012. In addition to two Brit Awards, Best British Male in 2000 and Outstanding Contribution to Music in 2003, he also won an MTV Video Music Award in 1989 and a Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1966.</p><p>For his contributions to music, he was awarded an OBE in 1998 and a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005. Due to his work as a coach on the talent competition The Voice UK, his popularity increased in the 2010s (2012–present).</p><p>The sound of American soul music influenced Jones’ singing technique. Little Richard, Solomon Burke, Jackie Wilson, Brook Benton, Elvis Presley (his hero and subsequently close friend), Jerry Lee Lewis, and other blues, R&B, and rock and roll performers were among his earliest influences.</p><p>“The Ballad of Tom Jones” by Space and Cerys Matthews is a song about a quarreling couple who are consoled by Tom Jones’ music while listening to the radio. In the UK, the song peaked at No. 4 in 1998.</p><p>Theatr na ng’s musical Tom: A Story of Tom Jones, based on the musician’s life and recordings, debuted in March 2016 at the Wales Millennium Center.</p><p>What’s New Pussycat, another jukebox musical? Based on Henry Fielding’s 1749 book The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, which features Jones’ songs and is set in the 1960s, premiered to rave reviews in October 2021 at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre.</p><p>Joe DiPietro is the author, Luke Sheppard is the director, and Arlene Phillips is the choreographer. Jones has impersonators all around the world, much like Presley did with his.</p><p>Roddy, the main character in the 2006 movie Flushed Away, gets mistaken for Jones by another character while singing “She’s a Lady.” The “What’s New Pussycat?” song by Jones is played during the closing credits.</p><p>In the computer game Team Fortress 2, the Scout character is a fan of Tom Jones memorabilia, and in the accompanying comics, Jones is shown being slain by the Soldier character.</p><p>Later, the spy persona utilizes his capacity for shape-shifting to persuade Scout that Jones is his father. Additionally, Jones is seen multiple times saying, “What’s new pussycat?”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much is Tom Jones worth?</h2><p>Jones is said to have a net worth estimated to be about $250 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does Tom Jones have any properties?</h2><p>Tom Jones owns a few expensive mansions and luxurious cars.
