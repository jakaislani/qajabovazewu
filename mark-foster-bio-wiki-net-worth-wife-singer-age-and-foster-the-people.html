His early years in Los Angeles were very difficult for him. He said that for eight good years he has just been that kind of starving artist delivering pizzas, sleeping on couches, and sleeping his car.</p><p>He worked various odd jobs which include bar-tending, waiting tables, telemarketing as well as painting houses. Mark in a 2012 interview ith Tha Baltimore Sun, talked of how he valued bartending and encouraged aspiring musicians to follow in his footsteps. He said that in Los Angeles, waiters in Los Angeles make over $100, 00 a year. He did not have much success in his first years in Los Angeles.</p><p>His band nearly secured a record deal in New York at the age of 21. He was given an opportunity, two years later, o work with Dr. Dre’s record label, Aftermath Entertainment. The deal however failed. He -composed and performed lead vocals on the Toques’ song “Breakdown” which was featured in the 2006 film Stick It.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mark-foster-the-foster-people></span><span>Mark Foster The Foster People</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the year 2008, Mark landed a job for the record label Mophonics as a commercial jingle writer. Mark was able to write jingles, in this position, for companies such as Honey Bunches of Oats as well as Verizon. At this time, he was still struggling with finding the right tunes to further break into the music industry. He later came to realize that he needed help in the form of members of a band due to the issues of writer’s block.</p><p>Mark, the following year, in 2009, recorded and released his first and so far, only solo album, Solo Songs. The album had nine tracks, It included demo versions of two songs from the Torches album, “Don’t Stop (Color on the Walls)” and “I Would Do Anything for You.” A. It as well had a song called “Polartropic (You Don’t Understand Me)”. “Polartropic (You Don’t Understand Me)” was featured in the soundtrack of the 2012 animated film Frankenweenie.</p><p>In order to support his record, Mark played solo shows around Los Angeles. Mark organized a three-person band in October 2009, him, colleague Mark Pontius, and longtime friend Jacob “Cubbie” Fink. His namesake Mark Pontius was so appreciative of Foster’s style of music. He left his band Malbec to join him as the drummer of the new band. Jacob had at that time lost his position at a television production company.</p><p>He left as a result of the recession. He joined Foster’s band as a bassist. The band was to be called “Foster and the People.” However, many people mistook the name as “Foster the People.” He later decided to name it the latter instead. Mark did prefer the title “Foster the People” as it conjured an image of care and development. The band released their first song which was titled “Pumped Up Kicks”.</p><p>Pumped Up Kicks” was a song about gun violence that they recorded at Mophonics in 2009. Mark wrote and recorded the song in five hours using Logic Pro software. He had originally intended it to be a demo. Suddenly the demo ended up becoming the full version of the song. They released the song in early 2010. Luckily, the song did well and went all over the internet.</p><p>It eventually made its way to television shows like Entourage as well as advertising campaigns for companies like Nylon. Due to the song’s increasing success, the band in May 2010, was signed to Columbia Records imprint Startime International for a multi-album deal. The song was officially released on September 14, 020. The song was in January 2011, released on the band’s first non-commercial single release, Foster the People.</p><p>It started to climb the American charts a few months later. On September 10, 2011, the song had peaked at number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100. In February 2012, the song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. The band’s first studio album was Torches which was released on May 23, 2011. This earned Mark his s second Grammy Award nomination, won for Best Alternative Music Album.</p><p>It did peak at number 8 on the Billboard 200. Mark produced electronic music as Mister Smims of the duo Smims & Belle alongside som Innis. Mark’s band released its second album, Supermodel on March 14, 2014. They then released their third album Sacred Hearts Club on July 21, 2015. Foster the People have since released a further EP, an additional four singles, and several collaborations. Mark Foster is currently writing a horror film.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mark-foster-personal-life></span><span>Mark Foster Personal Life</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mark bought from actor Maurice Benard(who portrays Sonny Corinthos on the ABC soap opera General Hospital) a $2.1 million property in the Hollywood Hills in 2013.
