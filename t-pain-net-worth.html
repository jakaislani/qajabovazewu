Faheem named himself T-Pain as the letter T stands for his hometown Tallahassee, with Pain signifying the early struggles in his life there. T-Pain’s family was a very religious one, however, T-Pain was not interested in religion at all, but decided to dedicate his life to music from a very early age, possibly starting when he was three years old and with his parents visited the recording studio of <a href=#>Ben Tankard</a>, who was his parents` friend. Ben is known as a famous speaker and jazz music producer.</p><p>So how rich is famous US rapper T-Pain? Sources estimate that T-Pain’s net worth is $30 million,with his wealth reaching such an amount because the worldwide-known rapper is also an actor, a songwriter and a record producer.</p><h3>T-Pain Net Worth $30 Million</h3><p>T-Pain was only 10 years old when he decided to start making recordings. In order to do that, T-Pain made a mini recording studio in his bedroom wherein the main items were a 4-track recorder, keyboard and a beat machine. However, it was not until the 2000s that T-Pain came into prominence, when he became a member of the band Happy Headz. T-Pain is also known for releasing a cover of Locked Up, a song by <a href=#>Akon</a>.

It reached 33rd position on the US Billboard 200, and this was when T-Pain became internationally popular. For that, T-Pain received a certificate of Recording Industries Association of America`s Gold.</p><p>T-Pain then released his second album Epiphany in 2007, which managed to sell approximately 170,000 recordings in the first week after release, and reached #1 on the Billboard 200 chart. The most popular singles are considered to be Church, Buy You a Drink along with <a href=#>Yung Joc</a>, and Bartender alongside <a href=#>Akon</a>. T-Pain’s third album Thr33 Rings, released in 2008 sold more than 168,000 copies in its first week after release, and went to #4 on the Billboard 200 chart.</p><p>T-Pain’s fourth album rEVOLVEr was eventually released in December 2011 after considerable angst between T-Pain and contributing artists. A fifth album called Stoicville – the Phoenix is scheduled for release in 2015.</p><p>T-Pain also increased his net worth with the incomes from Nappy Boy Entertainment, a record label company founded by himself. T-Pain`s talent in music was proven by his receiving two Grammy Awards.</p><p>T-Pain has also done some acting. In May 2009, he made his debut in an episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force as Frylock.
